## SourceCodester scraper

It is a console app that downloads PHP projects from [https://www.sourcecodester.com/php-project](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php-project).
It also builds various reports in CSV or HTML format.


The app allows you to find an appropriate PHP project to build from scratch. I think the amount of tables in the DB schema is a good indicator for a such thing. As a starting point we have:
- a complete web app with all the screens ready
- a sliced Photoshop/Figma template

It is time to rebuild it using modern approach to web development! :-)
